# Neighborhood-Associations-Parser
The Python program will get zip files that will be placed in the /core/Exports folder and extract them to a csv file.
It will then make some changes to the csv file to match the Caspio data to the currrent MariaDB database.
Next it will run an Update to update any data in the MariaDB database with the changed date from Caspio.

In the core/settings.py file:
1. The "/Neighborhood-Associations-Export.zip" must be changed to match the Caspio zip filename that will be exported
    >> export_file = Path(str(export_path) + "/Neighborhood-Associations-Export.zip")
2. The "/Neighborhood_table.csv" must also be changed to match the Caspio zip filename that will be extracted
    >> file = Path(str(export_path) + "/Neighborhood_table.csv")

In the core/database.py file:
1. Create a core/database.py

    import MySQLdb


    # Database connection
    db_connection = MySQLdb.connect(
        host="hostname",
        user="username",
        passwd="password",
        database="databasename"
    )
